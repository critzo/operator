m-lab/operator
=============

m-lab/operator is a repository for tools, configuration, and notes that help
operators manage the platform and experiments on M-Lab.

Directories:

 plsync -- synchronization scripts and configuration files for 
           mlab sites & slices

 tools -- command line tools of general use to operators for DRAC management,
          simple shell-script execution across all machines, and a command-line
          wrapper for interacting with the plcapi.
